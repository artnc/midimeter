Midimeter
=========

This little Python program displays a real-time heatmap as you play a keyboard or any other MIDI controller.

I wrote this in 12th grade and haven't really touched it since then. The screenshot below shows Midimeter's final state after playing Kyle Landry's arrangement of Beauty and the Beast.
